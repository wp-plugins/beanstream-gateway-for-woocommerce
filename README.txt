A Payment Gateway for WooCommerce allowing you to take credit card payments using Beanstream.

== Description ==
= What is Beanstream? =
[Beanstream] (https://www.beanstream.com/) allows you to process credit cards through its gateway. This plugin aims to show anyone that they can use Beanstream to take credit card payments in their WooCommerce store without having to write a single line of code. All you have to do is copy Merchand id and API pass key to a settings page and you're done.

= Why Beanstream? =
Beanstream allows you to take credit card payments without having to put a lot of effort into securing your site. Normally you would have to save a customers sensitive credit card information on a seperate server than your site, using different usernames, passwords and limiting access to the point that it's nearly impossible to hack from the outside. It's a process that helps ensure security, but is not easy to do, and if done improperly leaves you open to fines and possibly lawsuits.
If you use this plugin, all you have to do is include an SSL certificate on your site and the hard work is done for you. Credit card breaches are serious, and with this plugin and an SSL certificate, you're protected. Your customers credit card information never hits your servers, it goes from your customers computer straight to Beanstream servers keeping their information safe.

= What now? =

Go to the WooCommerce settings, click the checkout tab, then click the Beanstream for WooCommerce link at the top of the page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does I need to have an SSL Certificate? =
Yes you do. For any transaction involving sensitive information, you should take security seriously, and credit card information is incredibly sensitive. This plugin disables itself if you try to process live transactions without an SSL certificate. You can read [Beanstream's reasaoning for using SSL here](http://developer.beanstream.com/tag/ssl/).

= Does this plugin work with Subscriptions? =
No. But If you want this plugin to work on subscriptions, You can contact me at vkuberan@outlook.com
